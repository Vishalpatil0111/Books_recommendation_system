# 📚 Book Recommendation System

Welcome to the Book Recommendation System project! This repository contains a machine learning model that uses cosine vectorization to recommend books based on user input. The recommendation system is built using a Flask framework to provide a simple and interactive web interface.

## 🌟 Features

- **Cosine Vectorization**: Utilizes cosine similarity to find and recommend books similar to a user's input.
- **ML Model**: Employs a machine learning model to enhance recommendation accuracy.
- **Flask Framework**: Provides a web interface using Flask for user interaction and book recommendations.

## 📊 Dataset

The system is built on a dataset that includes various features of books such as:
- `title`: The title of the book.
- `author`: The author of the book.
- `genre`: The genre of the book.
